#100-Days-of-Code
Just started couple of days ago the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu

I am currently managing my time not only for the lessons, but also for setting a fresh working environment for coding. I am not a beginner, but it’s been a long time since I last wrote code, so I wanted to start again. And for that reason I am doing the first lessons a bit fast, writing most of the code to the “main.py” file, commenting and keep coding in it.

As I get going, I’ll add more to this repository and in addition I intend to make a daily log file of my progress (most likely this will be in the form of an html file).

So that’s all for now and Happy Coding!
