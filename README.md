#100-Days-of-Code
I've started the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu

Although I can’t consider myself new in programming, there are some aspects in python I baffle with. Trying to learn more, obviously get better in writing code, and perhaps eventually pursue a career in programming.

Most of the first lessons are just done in “main.py”, comment everything and move on. As I progress though, more and more exercises will be in different files, as some of my own.

So that’s it for now and Happy Coding!
